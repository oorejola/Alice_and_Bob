    "# Prisoner's Dilemma\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate two instances of GPT-3.5 in their play of the iteratied prisoners dilemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) is a fundamental model in the study of strategic interaction and cooperation in game theory, extending the classic Prisoner's Dilemma to a repeated context. In the basic Prisoner's Dilemma, two players simultaneously decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D), with the payoffs arranged such that mutual cooperation yields a moderately good outcome for both, mutual defection results in a worse outcome for both, and one-sided defection gives the defector a high reward at the significant expense of the cooperator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round of the IPD are scored as follows.\n",
    "If Alice and Bob both cooperate they each recieve 3 point.\n",
    "If Alice cooperates while the Bob defects, Alice recieves  0 points and Bob recieves 5 points.\n",
    "If Bob cooperates while the Alice defects, Bob recieves  0 points and Alice recieves 5 points.\n",
    "If Alice and Bib both defect, they each recieve 1 point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their goal is to maximize the total number of points for the duration of the IPD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma differs by repeating this interaction for multiple rounds, allowing strategies that can evolve based on the history of play. This repetitive nature introduces dynamics not present in the single-shot version, as it enables players to influence future behavior of their opponent through their current action choices. We simulate this interaction via LLMs.\n",
